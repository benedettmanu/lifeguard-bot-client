# Lifeguard Bot Client

This is the client for the Lifeguard Bot, a web application built with Next.js. The project was bootstrapped with `create-next-app`.

## Environment

This project requires Node.js v19.9.0.

## Install deps

To install the required dependencies, you can use npm, the Node.js package manager. We recommend using nvm (Node Version Manager) to manage your Node.js versions.

First, switch to Node.js v19:

```bash
npm i --legacy-peer-deps
```

## Getting Started

To start the development server, run the following command:
